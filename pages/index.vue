      <p>
        Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth
        during the Mesozoic Era, living for over 180 million years. They ranged
        from small, bird-like creatures to massive giants like the Tyrannosaurus 
        rex, a fearsome predator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The age of dinosaurs began in the Triassic Period and ended in the
        Cretaceous Period, when a mass extinction event led to their demise.
        Scientists study fossils to understand how these creatures lived and
        evolved over millions of years.
